Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The focus of this task is on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset, chosen for its effectiveness in showcasing essential data analysis techniques.

Dataset
The Titanic dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides details about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic information and survival status. Frequently used in data science education, this dataset offers a practical foundation for identifying patterns and relationships within historical data.

Dataset Details
The Titanic dataset contains both numerical and categorical data, with the following columns:

Passenger ID: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status of the passenger (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger's socio-economic class (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger (fractional for values below 1; estimated ages are noted as xx.5)
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouse aboard
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Ticket price
Cabin: Cabin assigned to the passenger
Embarked: Port of embarkation
Task Overview
The goal of this task was to utilize data cleaning and EDA methods to uncover insights from the Titanic dataset. This process involved managing missing values and examining relationships between variables to identify key factors affecting survival.

Key Analysis Insights
Addressed missing values and eliminated duplicate records to ensure data quality.
Explored relationships between factors such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival status.
Discovered patterns such as a higher survival rate among females, the impact of passenger class on survival, and the influence of age on survival outcomes.

Conclusion
This analysis of the Titanic dataset through data cleaning and EDA has shed light on factors that affected survival rates during the disaster. These findings offer historical insights while demonstrating the value of data science in interpreting real-world events.

Highlights:
Gender Disparity: The survival rate for females was significantly higher than for males, following the "women and children first" protocol of the time. This trend aligns with historical norms that prioritized women and children in rescue efforts.

Passenger Class Disparity: Class 3 passengers had the highest occupancy yet the lowest survival rates, suggesting a potential correlation between socio-economic status and survival. Passengers in higher classes likely had better access to lifeboats and other resources during evacuation.

Gender and Passenger Class Interaction: Further analysis showed that males in Class 3 had the lowest survival rates, indicating a combined effect of gender and socio-economic class on survival outcomes. Male passengers in lower classes faced a heightened risk of not surviving the disaster.

Age Factor: Younger adults had lower survival rates, hinting at age-based survival patterns. The prioritization of younger individuals, consistent with the "women and children first" policy, likely influenced this trend.

Correlations with Survival: Variables such as fare, gender, socio-economic class (Pclass), and port of embarkation (Embarked) showed correlations with survival outcomes, emphasizing their importance in determining survival probabilities during the Titanic disaster.
